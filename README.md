**Status: DEV**

**Ginseng.Genesis Open Core** personifies **Open Source Technologies** that are ready to be leveraged by *Open Minded Developers* to build a better future for us all.

The **Genesis** release focuses on providing an [Automorphisic](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Automorphism.html) system to model **Web Software Systems and their Tools** applied to **Real World Problems** and *instantly manifest* them.

The *explicit intention* is to seed a **Common & Open Distributed Tooling Foundation** that can be leveraged for building **Community Maintained Systems** by combining key concepts and technologies.

> [I Christoph Dorn](http://ChristophDorn.ceo) dedicate **Ginseng.Genesis Open Core** to my wife, love & light Tabatha who, after more than 10 years of trust and patience, is still my biggest supporter no matter what we were faced with. I hereby release **Ginseng.Genesis Open Core** to the *World* by [UNLICENSING](http://unlicense.org/) everything. **Set yourself free** as I plan on doing in collaboration with others! Join me and we will get there much faster together.

In traditional terms, **Ginseng.Genesis Open Core** is a portable web-app-shell that boots itself from a specific sequence of JSON declarations and connects to the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web).

to bear on **Web Software Systems and their Tools**. The goal is to embody these into an *Open Virtual Cloud of Information* that can provide context for all *Open Source Developers* when working on hard problems we need to solve for a better future.


Technologies
============

The following technologies (among others) provide a core stack that has the *potential to be unified into a single kernel of logic and universal manifestation platform*. As of 2015, these technologies combined with many others in **Ginseng.Genesis Open Core** may provide the foundation from which to model seemingly all things, processes and events in our dual force universe using an open platform.
